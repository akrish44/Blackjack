1. What is still broken (or not quite perfect) about your program? Why?
  The only thing that is not quite perfect within my code is the double down action. The action does double the bet placed
  on a player's hand, but does not automatically add another card to the hand. Also, the bet option works for the most
  part, but only fails to work when the "bet" button is clicked five or more times consecutively.

2. What is the best single feature of your program? What sets it apart from other students' work?
   The best single feature of my program would have to be the layout. I wanted to make the layout easy to read and the fact
   that it displays each card and tells you both your balance and how much you bet at the end of the game distinguishes
   it from other students' work.

3. How are classes in Java used to create a complicated program?
   If the entire program was created using one class, not only would the code be excessive, but it would also be difficult
   to understand. If someone were to read the code and try to understand what it means, the classes make it much easier to
   follow. Also, separating specific parts of the program allows the programmer to locate exactly where within the code each
   function is occurring.
  
4. What is the difference between a private and public variable? Method?
   Private variables can only be accessed within a specific class and public variables can be accessed from any class.
5. What is the difference between a class and an instance?
6. What is inheritance and why is it beneficial?
7. What is the purpose of the keyword this? What about super?
8. What are the two properties of all objects?
9. What is something about Object Oriented Design that still confuses you?
